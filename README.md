# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Grocery Analysis
My analysis on the Grocery Data.
Overview of Project
The data provided to me with online file: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Grocery_v1_00.tsv.gz
, represents a raw information of grocery data.
Results
      • The total vine review is 16612 and 2385812 non-vine review
•	There are 20 five-star vine review(paid) and 15689 five-star non-vine (unpaid)review
•	The percentage of five -star vine review is 0.33, The percentage of five -star non-vine review is 0.55

Summary
-I would suggest few other analyses to see how the rating review is connected to non-vine review and find what may or may not influence the vine rating.
- I would also analyze the review_headline column and do some deep analysis to find what are the possibilities to improve the stars rating.
